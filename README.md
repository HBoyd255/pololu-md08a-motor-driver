_"This tiny board is an easy way to use Toshibaâ€™s TB6612FNG dual motor driver,
which can independently control two bidirectional DC motors or one bipolar
stepper motor. A recommended motor voltage of 4.5 V to 13.5 V and peak current
output of 3 A per channel (1 A continuous) make this a great motor driver for
low-power motors."_
